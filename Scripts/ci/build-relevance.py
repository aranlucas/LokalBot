"""Decide whether a pull request needs the Build workflow's macOS jobs.

Build's checks are required, so the workflow always runs and reports them. A
pull request that changes only documentation, the website, marketing assets,
video or distribution notes skips the compile and tests; GitHub reports a job
skipped by its condition as passing. Everything else builds, including the
files the app bundles (PRIVACY.md, LICENSE, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md and the
CLI skill) and Benchmarks/, which unit tests read. Pushes, schedules,
dispatches and calls always build.
