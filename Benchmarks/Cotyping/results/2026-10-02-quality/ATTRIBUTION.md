The external synthetic phrase corpus and Cotabby-generated benchmark artifacts
come from [FuJacob/cotabby](https://github.com/FuJacob/cotabby), revision
`7724926b3e93f14e3b576ba46ff52c4f64d9712d`.

Original corpus:
[`CotabbyTests/Fixtures/phrase-prediction-1337.json`](https://github.com/FuJacob/cotabby/blob/7724926b3e93f14e3b576ba46ff52c4f64d9712d/CotabbyTests/Fixtures/phrase-prediction-1337.json),
SHA-256 `b41c8089a58ae1e0ee84b95ac9283cf71db4e713e25bd8fed47220be69d8b0f6`.

The upstream project publishes it under GNU AGPL version 3. A verbatim copy
of its [license](COTABBY-LICENSE.txt) accompanies these artifacts. The raw archive
includes derived synthetic typed-prefix inputs and reference words, not a
separate complete copy of the original corpus. `cotabby-gemma-matched` contains
upstream report structures and selected phrase records. The corpus is consumed
only by benchmark tooling; it is not bundled into the application.

The independent `Benchmarks/Cotyping/quality-cases.json` fixture was authored
for this evaluation and does not copy Cotabby phrases. All benchmarks use
synthetic writing, not the user's messages or saved writing history.
